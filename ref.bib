ABSTRACT = {Object detection is a pivotal research domain within computer vision, with applications spanning from autonomous vehicles to medical diagnostics. This comprehensive survey presents an in-depth analysis of the evolution and significant advancements in object detection, emphasizing the critical role of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. We explore a wide spectrum of methodologies, ranging from traditional approaches to the latest DL models, thoroughly evaluating their performance, strengths, and limitations. Additionally, the survey delves into various metrics for assessing model effectiveness, including precision, recall, and intersection over union (IoU), while addressing ongoing challenges in the field, such as managing occlusions, varying object scales, and improving real-time processing capabilities. Furthermore, we critically examine recent breakthroughs, including advanced architectures like Transformers, and discuss challenges and future research directions aimed at overcoming existing barriers. By synthesizing current advancements, this survey provides valuable insights for enhancing the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of object detection systems across diverse and challenging applications.},

abstract="We present a new framework for Patch Distribution Modeling, PaDiM, to concurrently detect and localize anomalies in images in a one-class learning setting. PaDiM makes use of a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) for patch embedding, and of multivariate Gaussian distributions to get a probabilistic representation of the normal class. It also exploits correlations between the different semantic levels of CNN to better localize anomalies. PaDiM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches for both anomaly detection and localization on the MVTec AD and STC datasets. To match real-world visual industrial inspection, we extend the evaluation protocol to assess performance of anomaly localization algorithms on non-aligned dataset. The state-of-the-art performance and low complexity of PaDiM make it a good candidate for many industrial applications.",
